## chosen approach:

* MVVM
* RxJava
* DataBindingUtil

## The approach to architecture:

The app has already implemented the "Model" and since there are not too many user stories, it will
be a fairly small app which can be laid out with a Model-View-ViewModel architecture.<br/><br/>
Furthermore, since the app is in the initial development stages and doesn't have many features, I
have chosen
the <a href="https://proandroiddev.com/package-by-type-by-layer-by-feature-vs-package-by-layered-feature-e59921a4dffa">
package by layer</a> approach; `model` layer is already in a separate package so I put
the `ViewModel` layer in its own package as well.

--------------------------------------------

## ViewModel:

Reads data from `Model` and delivers them to `View`. None of the definitions in this layer should
have any direct references to the UI or XML layout. Remember that in a perfect implementation of
MVVM architecture, your `ViewModel` layer is so portable that you can just copy/paste it into
another project and it will be usable with minor changes.

### ViewModel/SpotHeroViewModelFactory.kt

Inside the `ViewModel` layer, I firstly implemented the `SpotHeroViewModelFactory` class which is
nothing more than a simple builder for our `ViewModel` and extends
the `androidx.lifecycle.ViewModelProvider` class. It simply makes sure that the class that intends
to communicate with `ViewModel` is compatible with `ViewModel` class (more info
found <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/Class#isAssignableFrom(java.lang.Class%3C?%3E)">
here</a>). It also injects an instance of our `SpotHeroApi` to the created `ViewModel` (to be used
for communication between `ViewModel` and `Model`).

### ViewModel/SpotHeroViewModel.kt

It's the main part of the `ViewModel` layer and extends the `androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel` class.
The needed dependedncy to `SpotHeroApi` has been injected to this class via a parameter in the
constructor. By using its reference to the `SpotHeroApi`, it gets an observable object which is
a `Single<List<Spot>>` and our Activities or Fragments in the View layer can define an instance of
this ViewModel class to get this list of Spots.


--------------------------------------------

## View:

This layer contains all the GUI of the app and Activities/Fragments. User interactions and user
generated data is captured in this layer and sent back to `ViewModel` in order to be processed or
saved into Model layer. <br/><br/> In a perfect implementation of MVVM, definitions inside this
layer are as lightweight as possible, and we try to never put heavy logic of the app in this layer.

I'm interested in scalability in apps so I'm assuming that in the future development iterations, the
UI will get more complex and we will need a `Binder` between `View` and `ViewModel` layers in order
to receive events from GUI and deliever them to ViewModel; and also deliever needed data from
ViewModel to View.

Due to the lack of time, I can't implement a `Binder` part of the architecture right now, but I'm
going to define an "
Event"
class which is the object containing user info. when the app size got bigger, we will try to
implement a "Binder" in order to make our fragments/activities as light-weight as possible and also
keep our ViewModel as portable as possible.

And also, "DataBindingUtil" was used to make the connection between xml layouts and View files
easier.

## SH3:

The ticket described in SH-4 will add a new screen to the app. Fully implementing this user story
includes these parts: üëáüëá
<ol>

<li>Designing the <b><u>UI XML</u></b></li>
<li>writing the Activity/Fragment in <b><u>View layer</u></b> that controls the UI </li>
<li>changing the <b><u>ViewModel layer</u></b> so it provides the needed data for this UI and accepts the user data gathered by this UI</li>
<li>Possibly updating the <b><u>Model layer</u></b> to save the data gathered via this UI in a local or online database</li>
<li><b><u>Test and Debug</u></b> the Activity/Fragment of this UI</li>
</ol>

‚ö†Ô∏è Remember that in this assessment, I'm only considering
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">minimum viable product</a> which
simply features all the needed conditions and uses standard android builtin libraries. Adding any
additional material design elements (such as animations, icons, and drawables) or updating the
features will take more time than what I have specified in here.<br/><br/>
‚ö†Ô∏è The calculation of number of hours that it will take me to implement this user story is highly
dependent to my current level of <u>*experience*</u> and <u>*speed*</u> in developing such a
scenario and getting it to a bug-free stable state. If I were asked the same question a few years
later, I probably would give a different answer as my level of experience and knowledge in
developing UIs will be different from what it is now.

<li><b>A brief overview of how you would implement the solution at a technical level</b></li>


<li><b>Any questions that the Product Manager should take back to the stakeholders</b></li>

* what's the age group of users?
* this UI will be used on Android phones/tablets or Android Auto?
* what payment methods are supported in this scenario? credit card? cash? pay pal? interac?
* what exactly should we do with the high-valued data (banking information and also the info that
  shows user's car will be at a specific location at a specific time)? save in device or upload it
  to the server?
* which parts of the info gathered in this page are to be uploaded to the server and which parts can
  be saved on screen?
* if we're saving them in the device, in which form they should be saved? as raw files in the SD
  card? key-value pairs in data store? or some other forms?
* if we're using some banking APIs for handling the checkout, should we hand over user's data to
  that API or we need to encrypt it at first and then give it to that API? What design patterns and
  software architectures we should use for performing app's transaction with those APIs?

<li><b>Any additional concerns or questions you have for the Product Manager or Product Designer</b></li>

* What design pattern will be chosen for performing this part of the project?
  
* If we decided to encrypt users data (no matter whether we save that encrypted data on device or
  upload it to the server), should we perform the encryption by our own or can we use a 3rd party
  library? if it's private key encryption, how should we save and manage our key?

* In this part of the app we need to make a network call and send user-created data to a server on cloud, how we're going to manage the network call? The web server we're communicating with is RESTFul? the data we send or receive is in JSON format or XML or something else?
  
* What are the statistics bout the common device specs and network speeds of the current users of this app? the majority of our current users are on high end devices with speedy network connections or they're usually using less powerful devices with low speed of network connection? 
  
* It's obvious that the code which performs this UI will fire up a network connection and has to perform some heavy CPU calculations on handheld devices. What approach to mutithreading will we take? we'll go for *Reactive Programming* and work with data flows; or we'll choose any other technique for asynchronous programming?
